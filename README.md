### Metrics Used

1. Visual Comparison: Just by looking, ESRGAN has better picture quality.
2. PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio): Measures the similarity between the original and enhanced images. Higher PSNR values indicate better image quality.
3. SSIM (Structural Similarity Index): Evaluates structural similarity between images. A higher SSIM suggests better quality.

#### SwinIR Metrics

- Average PSNR: 28.29
- Average SSIM: 0.87

#### ESRGAN Metrics

- Average PSNR: 23.17
- Average SSIM: 0.78
